Fed up with lengthy and confusing Terms of Service (ToS) and Privacy Policies? ToS Summarizer AI helps you cut through the legal jargon!
Using the power of Google's Gemini AI, this extension provides concise summaries of web page content, with a special focus on identifying key clauses typically found in legal documents.

**Features:**

*   **AI-Powered Summaries:** Get easy-to-understand summaries of long texts.
*   **Warning Highlights:** Potentially concerning clauses (like data sharing, arbitration, liability waivers) are automatically flagged in the summary.
*   **Two Modes:**
    *   **Summarize Full Page (Auto-Detect):** Intelligently tries to find and extract the main legal text from the current page for summarization.
    *   **Summarize Selected Text:** Manually select any text on a page and get a summary of just your selection.
*   **Copy Summary:** Easily copy the generated summary to your clipboard.
*   **Activity Indicator:** See when the extension is working on your summary.

**IMPORTANT - API Key Required:**

*   To use this extension, you **must** obtain a free API key from **Google AI Studio** (for the Gemini API).
*   **How to get a key:** Visit [https://aistudio.google.com/](https://aistudio.google.com/), sign in with your Google account, and click "Get API key" -> "Create API key in new project."
*   **Free Tier:** The Gemini API offers a generous free tier (typically 60 requests per minute) which is usually sufficient for personal use. If you exceed these free limits, Google's standard API charges may apply to *your* API key usage. This extension developer does not control these limits or charges.
*   **Why your own key?** This ensures the extension can scale without incurring costs for the developer and respects API usage policies. Your API key is stored locally in your browser by the extension and is only sent directly to Google's API when a summary is requested.
*   **Supported APIs:** Currently, only Google Gemini API keys are supported.
