# Privacy Policy for **ToS Summarizer AI** Extension

**Last Updated:** 7 May 2025

Thank you for installing **ToS Summarizer AI**. This Privacy Policy explains how the extension handles your data.

---

## 1. Data We **Do NOT** Collect

- **No personal data.**  
- **No browsing history.**  
- **No page data**, except the text you explicitly choose to summarize.  
- **No usage analytics or tracking.**

---

## 2. API Key Handling

- **User‑provided key.** The extension requires a Google Gemini API key that **you** obtain from Google AI Studio.  
- **Local storage only.** Your key is stored *solely* in your browser’s extension storage.  
- **Never shared.** It is never sent to the developer or any third party, except directly to Google when you request a summary.  
- **Treat it like a password.** Keep your key private and secure.

---

## 3. Data Sent to Google Gemini API

- **What is sent:** The text you choose to summarize + your API key.  
- **Why:** Needed for Gemini to generate a summary.  
- **Google’s use:** Governed by Google’s own policies:  
  - [Google APIs Terms of Service](https://developers.google.com/terms/)  
  - [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)  
- The extension developer has **no control** over how Google processes or stores that data.

---

## 4. Page Content Extraction

When you choose “Summarize Full Page,” the extension first extracts the main textual content **locally** in your browser. Only that extracted text is sent to Google.

---

## 5. No Other Third‑Party Servers

Other than the Google Gemini endpoint, the extension does **not** communicate with any external servers.

---

## 6. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. Notice of changes will appear in the extension’s store listing and/or this repository. Please review it from time to time.
